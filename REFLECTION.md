# Assignment Reflection

## Can I explain what my code does?

Yes, in my project I created a simple webpage that functions as a resume. It uses very basic HTML to structure the content. 
The CSS is used to style the webpage, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.


## What was my coding process?

I added the basic structure of the website, then added various `<div>`s that are needed to give the webpage more structure, then added additional elements/information as needed. I usually design the HTML of the webpage first, then add CSS to style it. I find it easier to visualize what needs to be done when the HTML is already mostly in place. 

## What challenges did I have?

I did not face any real challenges with this assignment. I found it to be quite straightforward. I would say the most challenging part was ensuring the webpage was responsive and accessible, but I managed to do that without too much difficulty.

## What would I do differently now?

I would add a bit more detail to my project. My actual "resume" lacks a ton of detail. Additionally, I could probably afford to add a few more design elements, like additional images to make the site really "pop".
