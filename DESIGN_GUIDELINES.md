# Design Principles

## Overall design principle

I try to keep close to the KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid) principle when designing my web pages. I tried to convey this in the design choices I made. 

## Font Choice

I chose the google roboto font family. It is a personal favourite font of mine and I believe it works very well for most general purposes.

## Colour scheme 

I tried to use the most basic colour scheme possible; grey on black usually looks really good & it is generally very accessible. 

## Layout/Additional accessibility details

For the image-list of programming languages I used a simple grid layout to keep everything aligned. This list is responsive and will stack vertically on smaller screens. For enhanced accessibility, there are hidden elements which provide text descriptions of each image/link for screen readers.

I used a simple flexbox layout for the portfolio section to keep everything aligned. This section is also responsive and will stack vertically on smaller screens. For enhanced accessibility, there are hidden elements which provide text descriptions of each image/link for screen readers.
